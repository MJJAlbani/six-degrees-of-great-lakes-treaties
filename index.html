                          During the late-eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, treaty negotiations served as critical sites of contact between Anishinaabeg – members of the Three Fires Confederacy of Ojibwe, Odawa, and Potawatomi – Americans, and peoples of mixed ancestry across the Great Lakes. While the United States government attempted to exert complete control over all the territory it claimed on paper, the Great Lakes region's Indigenous inhabitants strived to retain sovereignty within their <u><a href="https://decolonialatlas.wordpress.com/2015/04/14/the-great-lakes-in-ojibwe-v2/" target="_blank">homelands</a></u>. Over the course of several decades, many Anishinaabe and American individuals emerged as diplomats at multiple treaty negotiations that would reshape how both Native and Euro-Americans settled upon and interacted with the Lands around them. <i>Six Degrees of Great Lakes Treaties</i> is a digital cultural heritage project that uses <u><a href="https://gephi.org/" target="_blank">Gephi</a></u>, an open source data visualization platform, to illustrate linkages between individuals who presented themselves as representatives for their communities and nations time and time again. Although the Great Lakes region may be geographically vast, connections weaved through recurring diplomatic entanglements in the late-eighteenth and nineteenth centuries rendered it more socially close-knit than casual onlookers might expect.

                              At the core of <i>Six Degrees of Great Lakes Treaties</i> is an interactive visualization of connections between approximately 1,600 Anishinaabe and American signers of 24 treaties beginning with the Treaty of Greenville (1795) and ending with the Treaty of Detroit (1855). It can be viewed by clicking the "Visualization" button above. Initially, the aim of this project was to analyze the signers of <u><a href="https://www.cmich.edu/library/clarke/ResearchResources/Native_American_Material/Treaty_Rights/Text_of_Michigan_Related_Treaties/Pages/Map-of-Treaty-Cessions.aspx" target="_blank">11 treaties</a></u> that resulted in the cession of Indigenous Lands (pictured to the left) the United States government would eventually consolidate into the state of Michigan. However, it soon became clear that concentrating solely on these documents would produce an incomplete work of digital cultural heritage. In the decades following European contact, Ojibwe, Odawa, and Potawatomi peoples who called what is now Michigan home (indeed, whose descendents continue to call it home) navigated between borders Euro-American powers were attempting to cement. They transgressed territorial and national lines which remained remarkably permeable well into the nineteenth century.

                            <p class="text-white mb-0">
                              Thus, what started as a Michigan story quickly broadened to encompass most of the Great Lakes region, and it raised an assortment of important questions along the way. How, for instance, might Indigenous mobility in such a space coupled with Anishinaabe and American individuals' participation in multiple treaty negotiations have complicated American expansion and state formation efforts? Furthermore, what kinds of individuals repeatedly appeared to sign compacts with such significant consequences? The visualization <i>Six Degrees of Great Lakes Treaties</i> presents will hopefully help untangle the twisting and turning relationships late-eighteenth and nineteenth-century treaty signers shared.

                              To better understand how <i>Six Degrees of Great Lakes Treaties</i> could enrich analyses of late-eighteenth and nineteenth-century treaty negotiations, an examination of two documents is beneficial. First, there is the deed to Mackinac Island (pictured to the right), which Ojibweg in northern Michigan sold to the British government in 1781. On display in the deed are pictographs symbolizing the clans (or <i>nindoodemag</i>) of the Ojibwe signers who the document characterizes as "Representatives and Chiefs" of the "Nation of the Chipiwas." Perplexingly, though, none of these pictographs seem to resemble those of <i>nindoodemag</i> most commonly present at contemporary diplomatic engagements. Historian Heidi Bohaker <u><a href="https://read.dukeupress.edu/ethnohistory/article-abstract/57/1/11/8886/Reading-Anishinaabe-Identities-Meaning-and" target="_blank">argues</a></u> that "frequency variations [among <i>nindoodem</i> pictographs] reflect the political importance of some clans at specific locations." So, why would British officials invite members of <i>nindoodemag</i> whose presence around Mackinac Island was less pronounced than others to act as representatives at its sale? Considering a second document presents a potential explanation...

                                    Following the intercession of Indian Agent Henry Rowe Schoolcraft behind the backs of Ojibwe and Odawa diplomats, the Treaty of Washington (1836) led to the cession of over one third of the future state of Michigan to the United States government. Well before negotiations began, however, Schoolcraft was already maneuvering to boost Anishinaabe receptiveness to American terms. He dispatched his mixed ancestry brother-in-law, William Johnston, to Sault Ste. Marie to recruit some of his kinsmen to serve as Indigenous ambassadors. Consequently, Ojibwe leader Waub Ogeeg traveled to Washington, D.C. even though, as scholar Charles E. Cleland <u><a href="https://www.press.umich.edu/4875383/faith_in_paper" target="_blank">asserts</a></u>, he was "of the <i>addik</i>, or caribou, totem from western Lake Superior and...[therefore] not [one of the] legitimate speakers for people who resided at Sault Ste. Marie." Schoolcraft surely hoped that one of his relatives could sway other Anishinaabe leaders despite the dubiousness of his position as a proxy for his community. Thinking back to 1781, could the British have similarly brokered Mackinac Island's sale with Ojibweg they shared especially strong relations with regardless of <i>nindoodemag</i>?
